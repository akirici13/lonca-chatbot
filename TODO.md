# Performance Optimization TODO

## API Call Optimizations
- [ ] Batch multiple API calls into a single request
- [ ] Implement request queue for better request management
- [ ] Add response timeout handling
- [ ] Optimize prompt length and reduce token usage
- [ ] Reduce max_tokens for faster responses

## Caching Improvements
- [ ] Add LRU cache for FAQ service
- [ ] Implement caching for image embeddings
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed conversation context

## Image Search Optimizations
- [ ] Pre-compute and cache image embeddings
- [ ] Implement image hash-based caching
- [ ] Optimize vector search operations

## Conversation Context Management
- [ ] Limit conversation context to last N messages
- [ ] Optimize context formatting
- [ ] Implement efficient context storage

## Streamlit UI Optimizations
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for chat messages
- [ ] Only render visible messages
- [ ] Optimize container height and rendering
- [ ] Improve message rendering performance

## General Improvements
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add request rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add logging for performance metrics

## Priority Order
1. API Call Optimizations (highest impact)
2. Caching Improvements
3. Image Search Optimizations
4. Conversation Context Management
5. Streamlit UI Optimizations
6. General Improvements

## Notes
- Each optimization should be tested for performance impact
- Monitor memory usage when implementing caching
- Consider implementing optimizations incrementally
- Add performance metrics before and after each change
